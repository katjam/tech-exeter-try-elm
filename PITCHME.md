# About me

- Senior web engineer at Neontribe
- Not a frontend developer

Note:

- but really I'm less of a computer scientist - more a person who just likes making stuff that might make someone's life a little more enjoyable - and I'm using code to do that.  
- These days a lot of us cover many parts of the stack to lesser or greater extent. I've never thought of myself as a frontend dev - and the bulk of my coding experience is in writing backends and APIs in php.
- The lines are blurry


+++

- Optimistic
- Learn by doing
- I @fa[heart pink] javascript
- Open source, open minded

Note:

- In practice that means - I like to jump right in try first and fail later... then try again
- It would surprise my colleagues to hear that - So explain The runnnig of javascript - xxx the equality, freedom it creates xxx... I do not like reading or writing javascript.
- Collaboration and sharing for progress and inclusion

# Try Elm

No runtime errors. Safe and fun refactors!

## Katja Mordaunt
![](neontribe-logo.png)

Note:

- Senior dev at Neontribe. Working with web tech 10 years - not computer scientist/ engineer
- just like making stuff - use code.  
- Never thought of myself as a frontend dev - because I can't do visual design - most coding in backends and APIs in php.
- Last year I ended up leading a project that turned out not to need a backend... so I chose Elm

+++

## I like making stuff that helps

Note:
- Generally optimistic
- Learn by doing
- In practice that means - I like to jump right try, fail... then try again
- I love javascript
- It would surprise my colleagues to hear that - the running of js - equality, freedom it creates by having a core of universally supported standard on majority of our devices
- I do not like reading or writing javascript

---

## Assumptions I'm making about you

@ul
- Fun
- Safety & efficiency
- Client trust
- New tech = fun vs. Old tech = safe ??
@ulend


Note:

- You might not share the same approah to coding as me.
- Maybe you like to plan a whole structure instead of jumping in.
- But - you probably share some of the same goals...
- START LIST
- Don't mind having fun
- Value safety & efficiency
- You want your clients' trust to be well earned
- Might think new tech is fun - but old tech is safer
- Elm can help with that.

## This talk will not

@ul
- Teach you functional programming concepts
- Compare Elm with React, Vue and Angular 2.0
- Discuss the newly released Elm 0.19
@ulend

Note:
- Loads of people teach functional concepts better than I can
- one of the awesome things about elm is that you can forget it's functional
- Do first - understand later. CLICK
- won't make excuses or justifications about the size of the Elm community CLICK
- Note about 0.19 - some things have changed - but my examples will use 0.18
- If you are interested in any of those, come and see me later


+++

## This talk will

- Shine a little light on Elm and why I enjoy using it

Note:

## Our (fun) problem

Any of these look familiar?

![](js-stuff.png)

Note:
- Building user interfaces for amazing APIs
- Our tools = code - languages, libraries, frameworks, transpilers, editors/ ides (sadly not lego)
- We're lucky enough to be in a rapidly evolving industry.
- A few years ago we'd have written html, css and a bit of jquery Maybe used some templating
- Then got complicated - our code turned to unpredictable, unmaintainable, magic bits and scary bits we didn't want to touch
- Frameworks started popping up, and build tools and new syntaxes transpilers to help make it easier for us to control

![](elm-lang-home.png)

![](not-functional.png)

Note:

- Describes itself as: A delightful language for reliable webapps.
- And claims to "Generate JavaScript with great performance and no runtime exceptions." It sounds too good to be true.... but I am going to demonstrate that you can write type safe & functional without a phd in category theory or a lisp in sight.

+++

![](elm-lang-home.png)

- Uses ML style syntax
- Based on functional programming principles
- Statically typed
- Compiles to Javascript
- More than a language, defines an architecture that helps us write good code

Note:
-XXX Elm is a language based on functional programming principles that compiles to Javascript and defines an architecture that makes rapid prototyping, evolving and scaling web apps and maintaining a single source of truth easy.
- Instead of listing the benefits - let's see how it works.

## Anatomy of an Elm app

![](mvu.png)

Note:
- model - your 'state'
- update function like a react redux reducer - unidirectional dataflow 
- view - display
- subscriptions for outside events like time but not this example

+++
## Syntax

```elm
"Hello " ++ "Exeter!"
> Hello Exeter!

5 / 2
> 2.5

5 // 2
> 2

addTwoString : Int -> Int -> String
addTwoString x y =
  toString x ++ "+" ++ toString y ++ "=" ++ toString (x + y)

addTwoString 2 3
> "2+3=5"

if True then "yes" else "no"
> "yes"

names = ["Kris", "Rob"]

List.reverse names
> ["Rob", "Kris"]

List.length names
> 2

myFailureTuple = (False, "Oh no!", HomePage)
mySuccessTuple = (True, "Yay!", NextPage)

event = { attendees = 2500, name = "TechExeter Conference" }

event.name
> "TechExeter Conference"

.name event
> "TechExeter Conference"

{ event | attendees = 250 }
> { attendees = 250, name = "TechExeter Conference" }
```

@[1-2](Concatenate strings with `++`)

- Double quotes for strings single for characters
- Can't use numbers, strings or Lists as boolean - must be True or False
- No undefined fields. Can't ask for a field not defined. No self or this for recursive records.

## Html?

```
div [ class "list-of-stuff" ]
[
  h2 [] [ text "Short list of stuff"],
  ul []
    [
      li [] [ text "Item one"],
      li [] [ text "Item two"],
      li [] [ text "Item three"]
    ]
]
```

+++
## Html?

```
div [ class "list-of-stuff" ]
[
  h2 [] [ text "Short list of stuff"],
  ul []
    [
      li [] [ text "Item one"],
      li [] [ text "Item two"],
      li [] [ text "Item three"]
    ]
]
```
![](list-of-stuff.png)

+++

## Html?

divs and headings and lists

```
div [ class "list-of-stuff" ]
[
  h2 [] [ text "Short list of stuff"],
  ul []
    [
      li [] [ text "Item one"],
      li [] [ text "Item two"],
      li [] [ text "Item three"]
    ]
]

```
...and buttons and links etc

```
button [ onClick DoThing ] [ text "Do thing" ]
a [ href "/my-path" ] [ text "Follow the high road" ]
```

Note:
- html5 elements fully implemented

+++
## Html?
### Using elm-format

```
div [ class "list-of-stuff" ]
    [ h2 [] [ text "Short list of stuff" ]
    , ul []
        [ li [] [ text "Item one" ]
        , li [] [ text "Item two" ]
        , li [] [ text "Item three" ]
        ]
    ]
```

@ul
- elm-format -> One agreed standard
- Machine can parse with confidence
- No one forgets the commas
- Don't need trailing commas to eliminate bad diffs
@ulend

Note:
- I lied a liitle - it looks like this.
- But elm-fromat does that for you... so if it takes your muscle memory a while to retrain - don't worry.
- Like prettier but without the arguments over spaces, tabs and semicolons.

## Quick scenario

Note:
- ELM coder no problem. JS getting - which framework to choose?
- We'll follow the elm project. leave js up to your imagination.

@[85-92](Define a function that takes a Colour and outputs String)
@[11-13](Union types are great)

Note:
- A few months later you need support for hex colors
- You don't need to think about which funtions use Color or search them out
- Just add the option to your union type and the compiler will tell you

## Cool things for free
- Tooling elm-make and elm-reactor or create-elm-app or webpack
- Ellie - live online editor to share and compile code
- debugger import/ export
- tiny bundle sizes
- no accidental breaking changes
- Escape hatches to existing js code and libraries

Note:
- You can build projects how you are used to - or start with elm tools and get more complicated when you need to.
- Share funcitoning code snippets online with Ellie
- Export history with bug and import into another browser (QA team)
- Because 'function level dead code elimination'
- Elm package (diff versions to show changes) - enforced semantic versioning
- Start small - convert one part of your app to elm and keep building - Warning - the js isn't safe

---
## Join the Elm community
- Elm town, meetups, slack, discourse, great docs, conferences
- Great for learning - even for primary school children
- Easy for non-programmers - e.g. scientists needing visualisations

# About me

- Senior web engineer at Neontribe
- Not a frontend developer

Note:

- but really I'm less of a computer scientist - more a person who just likes making stuff that might make someone's life a little more enjoyable - and I'm using code to do that.  
- These days a lot of us cover many parts of the stack to lesser or greater extent. I've never thought of myself as a frontend dev - and the bulk of my coding experience is in writing backends and APIs in php.
- The lines are blurry

Note:

- In practice that means - I like to jump right in try first and fail later... then try again

# First some background
## Building a user interface

Distill list and move to Notes
- We're lucky enough to be in a rapidly evolving industry.
- A few years ago we'd have written html, css and a bit of jquery
- Maybe used some templating
- As we asked our browsers to handle interpreting more and more complex code - our code turned to unpredictable, unmaintainable, magic, held together by sticky tape...
- Frameworks started popping up, and build tools and new syntaxes that would make the code easier to use in the way we wanted to - and transpilers.

# So what is Elm?

Image elm home page 'delightful language'

Distill list and move to Notes
- Elm is a language based on functional programming principles that compiles to Javascript and defines an architecture that makes rapid prototyping, evolving and scaling web apps and maintaining a single source of truth easy.
- Describes itself as: A delightful language for reliable webapps.
- And claims to "Generate JavaScript with great performance and no runtime exceptions." It sounds too good to be true.... but I am going to demonstrate that you can write type safe & functional without a phd in category theory or a lisp in sight.
- Instead of listing the benefits - let's see how it works.
